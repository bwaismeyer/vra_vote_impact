# Introduction

This is a small project exploring voting patterns and the recent decline of the 
Voter Rights Act (VRA). It is my attempt to pull together some simple relevant
data and take a peek at how voting - especially by party - fluctuated around key
VRA events and changes in state voter ID laws.

## VRA and State Voter ID Events

As a first step, I created a simple spreadsheet containing key events related to
the VRA and to the implementation of voter ID laws in each state. The goal is to
use these events to observe how voting results change across elections, starting
with presidential elections.

## Election Data

There are a few places to search for election data on the web, all with their
own issues (e.g., organizational/monetary walls, completeness).

A good summary of election data sources can be found 
[here](http://libguides.princeton.edu/elections).

Somewhat arbitrarily, I ended up working with "Dave Leip's Atlas of US
Presidential Elections" (hosted [here](http://uselectionatlas.org/)). I mostly
picked it because it was reasonably easy to get the data, it had the coverage
I wanted, and it had the minimum data (returns by party) I was hoping to start
with.

## Studies of Voter Fraud

Though not the focus of my work here, the primary argument in favor of voter ID
is to prevent voter fraud. The extent of voter fraud is popularly presented as
controversial, though people who have actually studied appear to feel otherwise.

## Other Studies Exploring Voter ID and Voting

I didn't read this in depth, but I've started collecting them because it's nice
to know what other people have found or think.
